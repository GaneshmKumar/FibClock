> Don’t you find clock faces quite aggressive, their hands and numbers constantly reminding you of the passing of the time?  
> If so, this beautiful invention is for you.  
> The Fibonacci clock lets you know the time more subtly, by changing colors and requiring you do some adding up.  
> The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence beginning 1, 1 and where each number is the sum of the previous two. Its first five digits are:  
1, 1, 2, 3, 5  
> [Philippe Chrétien](http://basbrun.com/) from Montreal, Canada, noticed that these numbers are all you need to express all the numbers from 1 to 12.  
> * 1 = 1
> * 1 + 1 = 2
> * ....
> * 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12  
> Here’s what he did. It is possible to arrange squares whose side  lengths are the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence into a rectangle.  (This is the famous [Golden rectangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle)).  
> The squares in his clock have side length 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. The  squares lit up in red tell you the hour, and the squares lit up in green  give you the minutes (in multiples of five). A square lit up in blue  means it is to be added for both hour and minute. White squares are  ignored.  
> The first one below goes like this:  
For hours, you have red '5', red '1' and  blue '3'.   
5 + 1 + 3 = 9 o’clock.   
For minutes: green 2 and blue '3'.   
2 + 3 =  5. Then 5 x 5 = 25 minutes.   
So, the time is 9:25

This is a simple implementation of this amazing clock.
